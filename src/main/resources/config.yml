  #available modes: item, player, uuid
  #item: Saves all data inside the ItemStack and ignores the type config.
  #player: Saves all data using the type config. Holos are also per player, and everyone will see the same holo.
  #uuid: Saves all data using the type config. Holos also have a unique UUID so that each item has a different holo, similar to item mode.
